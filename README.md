OTP Email Service with Lockout Mechanism
This is a Spring Boot-based OTP (One Time Password) email service application. It allows users to receive OTPs via email and verify them within a specified timeframe. If a user enters the wrong OTP three times, they are locked out for 24 hours. During the lockout period, the system sends a notification email informing the user of the lockout status.

Features
Send OTP to an email address.
Verify the OTP within a valid time window (1 minute).
Block users after three incorrect OTP attempts.
Lock users for 24 hours after exceeding OTP verification attempts.
Send lockout notification emails to the user when they are blocked.

You will need to configure the SMTP server details for email sending. These settings are in the application.properties file.

properties
Copy code
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your-email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your-email-password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
Make sure to replace the spring.mail.username and spring.mail.password with your own email credentials. It's recommended to use app-specific passwords if using Gmail.

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/otp-email-service.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd otp-email-service
Update the mail configuration in application.properties with your SMTP credentials.

Build and run the application using Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Test the APIs using a tool like Postman or curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}' http://localhost:8080/api/sendotp
The application will start on port 8080 by default. You can change this in application.properties if needed.

Error Handling
If the user enters the wrong OTP three times, they will be locked out for 24 hours.
If a user is locked out, they will receive an email notification stating the lockout and will not be able to request another OTP during this time.
Future Enhancements
Integrate with Twilio for sending OTPs via SMS.
Add support for Redis or a database to store OTPs persistently.
Add multi-factor authentication for login with OTP.
